    First page I made

    For starters, I picked Elon Musk because I admire everything about him. He is the only person I am genuinely
    and wholeheartedly a fan of. He is the only person I would blindly listen to.

    Second, I chose a big picture to start the page because I like the aesthetic. It reminds me of Apple.com. They
    love using neat, clean, sharp pictures-- and it's always really sophisticated and elegant. 
    
    I also took inspiration from my favorite record label Republic Records. This is their home page. https://www.republicrecords.com/
    It's a full on picture, even as you scroll. It's black and white with a simple logo ontop. I think simplicity is elegant.
    I also took inspiration from their artist profiles like such. (https://www.republicrecords.com/artists/amy-winehouse) 
    Again, the simplicity is visual stunning. 

    As for the content, it's pretty simplistic. It has really wide margins (left and right) because I realized
    for some reason every publication does that. I looked at Vogue, Forbes, CNN. I would have done wider margins, but then 
    the page would be too long.

    I also really placed impoprtant emphasis on color. I learned HTML and CSS with FreeCodeCamp, and there was an entire
    section on Color Theory. I didn't want to have too many colors because it would clash with one another and make the site 
    have a different vibe than I was going for.

    I primarily used red. I thought red was visually stunning snd bold. 
     It also was light enough to contrast against the picture. I wish I could darken the picture with a filter, but I can't 
     figure it out. When I darken the picture, I also darken the text. I could not separate it. 
    
    Also, the fonts. I wanted a thick, bold, all-uppercase font ontop of the picture. And I wanted a skinny, somewhat simple 
    yet pecuilar font for the h2 and h3 headers. And lastly for the actual written content, I wanted a really simple font that
    had a bit spacing between each letter. I realize the font looks like Times New Roman, but I really liked the one I picked more. 

    Also, I experimented using the @media queries, but it takes too long and it's not a requirement. I probably won't be doing that
    for the next pages.

                         <h2 class="content-heading">About</h2>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink, and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport</p>

                         <p class="content-paragraph">Elon Musk is a polarizing figure in the tech and business worlds, but no matter what anyone thinks of him, he is an innovative disruptor that is tackling a wide set of issues. He may be best know for his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his ambitious rocket startup, SpaceX, but he has much more going on. </p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph"> Last January 2021, Elon Musk made headlines as he topped the world’s billionaires with a net worth of  $185 billion, replacing Jeff Bezos of Amazon as the previously hailed richest man in the world. Currently, Elon Musk’s net worth is approximately $172.5 billion. Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company are just some of the companies he is involved in. However, Elon Musk is not the only member of the Musk family in the limelight. Kimbal Musk is the co-founder of Square Roots, a company focused on reducing food waste, and which was dubbed as one of the most promising startups of 2019.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">He also co-founded the restaurant chain, The Kitchen and had been a board member of Chipotle. Tosca Musk is a filmmaker and an entrepreneur; she founded Passionflix, a video-on-demand streaming platform for romance movies. Cover Girl signed Maye Musk as an ambassador and model at age 69. She has also written a book entitled, A Woman Makes a Plan, sharing her childhood adventures in South Africa and what it takes to raise a billionaire.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">ter the 2008 financial crisis, Elon Musk’s companies started to take off. In December of 2008, the space exploration technologies corporation, SpaceX, closed a $1.6 Billion contract with NASA to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. In June of 2010, Tesla was able to raise $226 Million from the IPO. Elon Musk is becoming a household name in the tech industry. </p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph"> Here’s a quick list of the companies that Musk has founded that are disrupting legacy industries and creating new ones.</p>

                             <p class="content-paragraph">Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.</p>
                             <p class="content-paragraph">Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015. A mass market sedan, the Model 3 was released in 2017. As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020. The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.</p>

                            <h3 class="content-subheading" id="spacex-info"> SpaceX </h3>
                            <p class= "content-paragraph"> In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of chief engineer.</p>
                            <p class="content-paragraph">After three failed launches, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first private liquid-fuel rocket to reach Earth orbit. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise. Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9. Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload. In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities. In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon project. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed space-craft with the ISS. </p>
                            <p class="content-paragraph">SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.</p>

                            <h3 class="content-subheading" id="paypal-info">PayPal</h3>
                             <p class="content-paragraph">In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial months, over 200,000 customers joined the service. The company's investors saw Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year. The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition. Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service. Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7%—received over $100 million. In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.</p>

                            <p class="content-paragraph">In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels. In early 2017, they began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.A tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. As a merchandising and publicity stunt, The Boring Company sold 2,000 novelty flamethrowers in 2018.The idea was allegedly inspired by the Mel Brooks-directed film Spaceballs (1987).</p>

                            <p class="content-paragraph">In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with AI. Neuralink's purpose is to create devices that are embedded in the human brain to facilitate the merging of the brain with machines. The devices will also reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial intelligence to stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more effectively.</p>
