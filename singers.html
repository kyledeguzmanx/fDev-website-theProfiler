                       <p class="content-paragraph" style=" padding-top:50px;"> I listen to music every minute of every day. I play it while I sleep, wake up, drive, cook, bathe, study-- literally for anything. My addiction is made even worse with the internet of things. Music is so accessible with my phones, tablets, and the smart speakers littered throughout the house. And in addition to that, my ability to stream music on-demand is enabled by streaming services like YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud. </p>
                       <p class="content-paragraph" >My appreciation for music extends to many different genres — like pop, hip-hop, alternative, smooth jazz, indie, R&B, EDM and rock- — and many different decades — especially 50s and 60s Blues, 90s and early 00s R&B, and 80s rock and 80s smooth jazz.  I love classic ballads that make you feel something, but I also like pointless trap/pop records that are lyrical messes.</p>
                       <p class="content-paragraph">For the list I will present, these are artists I have a deep appreciation for. And this appreciation can come from many different places, for many different reasons. It might be their ability to perform, their ability to sing, or their ability to tell a story. Or it might be their song-writing. It might be their character and their personality.</p>
                       <p class="content-paragraph" style= "text-indent: 0px;">Here’s the list:</p>
                    </header role="banner">
                   <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">Ella Mai</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center"src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/84b/c25/2ff4dadd68fdb3999fad60b3f696f877f4-23-ella-ma.rsquare.w700.jpg">
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I think Ella Mai stylistically represents what true, modern R&B is. She's one of very few mainstream R&B singers that doesn't genre-bend and implement aspects of other genres like pop. If she produces an R&B record, that's exactly what you get. I appreciate the soulfulness in her delivery, especially in her R&B runs. I'm a big fan of 50s and 60s blues, specifically because R&B at the time was filled with soul and raw emotion. Ella Mai's songs are reminiscent of that vibe, but with a more modern twist.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Also, I'm a fan of her story. DJ Mustard, who produces a lot of Hip-Hop reocords, discovered her and brought her to his label. I'm a fan of his productions, and when the two artists work together, it alway results in a beautiful, refined product. Ella Mai is one of those artists who does not have a single song that I dislike. I can listen to her entire catalog for months without ever skipping a song.</p>                   
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">Chris Brown</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/5f/a5f52fc6-f3b3-5e5e-b223-e9521b8eb7ca/60fee3f6b7154.image.jpg?crop=650%2C650%2C175%2C0&resize=1200%2C1200&order=crop%2Cresize">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> I hopped on the Chris Brown train in 2019, I think. I discovered his 35-track album called Heartbreak on a Full Moon that's 3-4 hours long. And the same month I discovered that album, Chris Brown released his 2019 album Indigo which had 43 tracks, totaling another 3-4 hours. Those two albums were on repeat for a straight year. I completely adore every single song. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Chris Brown's has a very different approach to R&B than Ella Mai. He incoporates hip-hop, dance, and pop to make the overall atmosphere of his album light-hearted, fun, and groovy. His songs make me want to dance. His songs make me feel uplifted and hyped.  </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> And also, we can talk about his features. When Chris Brown collaborates with Hip-Hop and R&B artists -- like Tyga, Tory Lanez, Kanye West, Drake, HER, and DaniLeigh-- he always delivers. His features always liven up songs.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Lastly, Chris Brown is a performer. In my mind, and I know everyone disagrees, he is on the same level as Michael Jackson and Beyonce. I think Chris Brown is easily one of the best American performers.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">Cashmere Cat</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://images.sk-static.com/images/media/profile_images/artists/6359509/huge_avatar">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Cashmere Cat isn't a vocalist. He is a producer that works behind the scenes to create mainstream billboard-chart-toppers. He worked with Kanye West, Shawn Mendes, Lil Dicky, Halsey, Tory Lanez, and The Weeknd. He's actually worked with many big names in music. He's extremely talented and criminally underrated. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> On top of producing songs for other artists, he puts out music under his own name. His music is eccentric to say the least. He throws random sounds in his music, and it's definitely not for everyone. He makes my list because he embodies what being an artist means.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">Mikky Ekko</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/tGFKTbGWgT8fp2XExy8er5GIK4MoQodyBVtHPkhgC8vvGIdbNb8hjURhptQzLA3UouTTOMsnVCHk4fLSAPH2qUYGzIx_sHAWKJ3bE9ISPJfhbkNuf-GBTYQHiXRY_m0DLnA">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> This man will always be legendary to me. He is the man who wrote Stay which Rihanna popularized. That was actually how I was introduced to his work. Mikky Ekko produces a lot of ballads. His music is drenched with passion, soul, and gut-wrenching honesty. His style is very unique. It's very melodic. Similar to the first two artists mentioned, there is not a single song from his catalog that I dislike.  </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> And similar to the previous artist, this artist embodies artistry. Mikky Ekko writes his own songs, produces his own songs, and masters his owns songs. If you check the public song credits, it's literally all him.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">Jaymes Young</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712yxZ-PqUL._SY450_.jpg">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> This artists is very similar to the previous artist. He is a male singer-songwriter that single-handedly produces every single aspect of his released songs. He also produces many ballads about love, but his style is different. That's probably why he has received more mainstream attention that Mikky Ekko. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Similar to Ekko, this artist embodies artistry. His work is truly beautiful and timeless. </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="content-heading">MO</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc079119d329cce8adc4797c08382a32194984a/0_0_5017_3011/master/5017.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=71f7395bd038b2c01abefee93d3a8b08">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> MO is a frequent collaborater with EDM artists that I absolutely adore like Snakehips, Cashmere Cat, and Diplo. Naturally, when you hear an unfamiliar artist's name constantly show up, you listen to their work. MO, in my opinion, is one of the best electro-pop acts out there. It does not matter if she's singing on someone else's record or the record belongs to her, MO always knows how to carry a song with her voice. She makes songs memorable hits.  </p>

                    <h3 class="content-subheading">HER</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">HER is an award-winning Afro-Filipino R&B singer and song-writter. Unlike ELla Mai, HER doesn't really appear to take much influence from 90s and early 00s R&B. I think she equally represents what contemporary, pure R&B should sound like.   </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Consisting mostly of R&B ballads, H.E.R's songs have been described as "downcast post-breakup material that sounded vulnerable and assured at once".</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Addressing the secrecy over her identity, she has said: "The mystery is a metaphor for who I am, or who I was at the time of creating the project... I feel like oftentimes we don't like to be open as people about our emotions or things that we are going through. At the time [of recording], I was very closed off except for when I was writing or when I was in the studio."</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">She explained further: "I am a voice for women who feel like they're alone in these situations. This project came from emotion, and that's what I want it to be about – not what I look like or who I'm with, but the raw emotion and support for women."[29] To NPR she said, "I feel like this is the era of the anti-star. I really just wanted it to be about the music, and get away from, 'Who is she with?' and 'What is she wearing?'"</p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Tinashe</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Tinashe is also another R&B singer, but she heavily dips into pop. What make her memborable to me is her performance skills. While I enjoy her music, it's nothing revolutionary in terms of lyricism and musical style. I think her real strength is in perfornming, and she's one of the best performers in America right now. I think we have very few artists out right now that are performers. Most artists just stand there or have their backup singers carry the performance. And as of recently, you also have many artists that genuinely try to make an effort to be theatrical in their live performances, but they just don't hit the mark. Tinashe hits that mark every time, not only in live performances but in music videos as well.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I think another reason why I adore her is her story with the music industry. If you know how the music industry works and how money flows in their business, you would understand that artists easily receive different treatment based on their commercial success. Many artists are quick to antagonize their labels, but I don't necessarily agree with that. At the end of the day, they are a business and it's their money on the line. The artists are investments, and when their investment isn't returned, I can understand why they don't want to fund future projects. However, from the artists' standpoint, I completely understand why that's frustrating. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Tinashe is signed with RCA Records which is a Sony label. RCA has produced many phenomenal, mainstream artists that top the Billboard Hot 100. It's definitely a great label. However, there are many small, signed artists to RCA records that are vocal about their terrible experiences with RCA. Tinashe is one of those people. I respect every independent artists that's trying to make it in the music industry. That includes people like Russ, Iggy Azalea, and Chance the Rapper. I'm not truly invested in Iggy Azalea, but I can appreciate her story. </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">The Weeknd</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">The Weeknd is a fantastic example of an artists that grows sonically and lyrically. With every full, body of work he releases, he evolves, and his evolution is seamless. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">The Weeknd has had an abundance of commercial success. I didn't really appreciate him until his 2016 album, Starboy. That album is undeniably an R&B album, but he incoprorates alternative and pop influences as well. Throughout the album, he offers a consistent sound and style, but he also slowly transitions into a new type of sound that's heavily reminiscent of 80s pop music. And when his next album, After Hours, came out, that 80's influence became even more prominent. He, alongside a handful of other contemporary pop acts, brought the 80s back.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I have an appreciation for him because he, in my opinion, is one of the best male vocalists of this generation in music. And I was able to watch his artistic growth from reaching mainstream popularity in 2014 to present day. He will definitely be one of the musical elites the 2010s produced. </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Brendan Urie</h3>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Brendan Urie found mainstream success in the 2000s when I was barely reaching elementary school. He was the singer for the famous band Panic At the Disco! I don't really pay attention to his older albums. I mostly listen to his 2016 album Death of a Bachelor and any new songs that come out after that.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Even if I don't consume every album this man has put out, I actually have deep admiration for him. Vocally, I think he is the best male vocalist of his generation in music. Also, I know he is heavily involved with the production and song-writting aspect of making music. And his music is simply amazing. His album Death of a Bachelor is one of those albums where every song is a hit.</p>
                         <p class="content-paragraph">Lastly, Brendan Urie's story with his band is very inspirational. They were all high school friends that found mainstream success together. Slowly, one by one, everyone left, and Urie decided to carry on releasing music under the band name. So far, I think Brendan Urie is doing a fantastic job. Also, Panic at the Disco is associated with Fueled by Ramen which is another label I completely adore. Their roster includes Paramore, Hailey Williams, and Twenty One Pilots. </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Harry Styles</h3>
                         <p class="content-paragraph"> I started appreciating his music after he released his solo-single Kiwi. He was evolving as an artist and taking a completely different approach to music than his disbanded group One Direction. His solo projects have heavily infused rock and alternative sounds, and it suits him really well. His two solo projects "Harry Styles" and "Fine Line" are both musical masterpieces. His music videos, his lyrcism, and his overall sound are beautifully thought out and always executed really well. His music is filled with passion, soul, and heart, and his work is definitely timeless. I can easily see him as being one of the musical elites the 2010s produced. He is definitely up there.  </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Ambrosia</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> When i think of 70s and 80s music, Ambrosia will always be one of my favorite bands to come from that time of music. I would think of Lionell Richie, James Ingram, Earth Wind and Fire, Anita Baker, and Sade. I'm obsessed with Ambrosia. They have very feel-good albums. Their music is soft, gentle, and calming-- similar to smooth jazz. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Even if I wasn't alive when they were actively impacting radio, this band still gives me nostalgia. This was the music my mother listened to when she was growing up. She used to play this band all the time in the car. She would put in her CD of Ambrosia's greatest hits while we were driving to school, and my brother and I would sing along. This style of music and this time period in music is probably why I really adore soulful songs.</p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Earth, Wind, and Fire</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> As mentioned previously, I love Earth, Wind, and Fire. I mentioned a few other artists from this time of music; however, the reason I give Ambrosia and Earth, Wind, and Fire their own dedicated sections is because I love their albums. Every artist mentioned on this list are artists with complete albums that I absolutely adore. These are albums that I can repeat for months without skipping a single song. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Earth, Wind, and Fire is one of those bands that have gorgeous full-length albums that I love.  </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Dion DiMucci</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> 50s and 60s music is another category of music that I love. There's a lot of rock, blues, and doo-wop. To me, when I think of this era of music, one of my favorite is Dion DiMucci. He released music as a solo artist but also in a group called Dion and the Belmonts. His more famous songs include The Wanderer, A Teenager in Love, and Runaround Sue.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> I don't really know much about him or his story, but I really appreciate his contribution to that decade of music. He created many hit songs that my parents and I can sing out at the top of our lungs, and the atmosphere his music creates is always joyful and relaxed. </p>
