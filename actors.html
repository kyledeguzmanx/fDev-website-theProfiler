    The prompt was "The purpose of this lab is to create a personal site about one of your interests. 
    Examples include but are not limited to: favorite movie, show, book, artist, band, genre, sport, +
    team,person, place to visit,"
    
    It was originally going to be about Elon Musk, but then I got carried away with making the logo for 'The Profiler'
    and making the nav bar. And also, there's only so much information about Elon Musk. So, I'm going to claim
    that this personal website is about my favorite actors, my favorite entrapreneurs, and my favorite singers-- or 
    generally my favorite celebrities. 
    
    Also, since I'm steering in this new direction, i'm going to put information about why I like them in the
    actor.html, entrepreneur.html and singers.html-- and it doesn't quite make sense since I already made a dedicated elon musk
    page. But I like how pretty all the pages look so I'm going to run with it. 

    ----------------------This will be the fourth page I am working on. ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you skipped the Entpreneur and Singer pages, I basically said I want this page (actors.html) to look different. If I follow
    that general celeb name, picture, and description format(that I used in those aforementioned pages), 
    it will look like I didn't put a lot of effort. I'm going to try to make it different, but I will be subtle about it.

                    <p class="content-paragraph">Now, unfortunately for this section, I do not consume many motion pictures. Actors and actresses are a category of celebrities that I am outrageously blind to. There are many legacy actors and actresses that are houseoldnames, crowd-favorites, and are seen in many movies throughout the years-- and I still do not know who they are.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph"> Further, I am also the type of person who will rewatch entire seasons or films that I love, instead of watching a newly released production. You can say I'm really behind on which actors and actresses are relevant at the moment.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">I will say, though, that I do like watching press tours and celebrity interviews in late night talk shows. I'll even watch people that I don't really know. So even if I have never watched the films or shows of some of these celebrities, I can still have an appreciation for them.</p>

                    <p class="content-paragraph"> Jennifer Lawrence is a film actress that's most recognized for The Hunger Games, Joy, American Hustle, Red Sparrow, and Mother. I haven't seen more than half of those movies, but I still appreciate her. She is effortlessly hilarious. Her interviews always drown me in laughter. I especially love her interviews with <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome">Stephen Colbert</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheEllenShow">Ellen Degeneres</a>. Also, when she was doing the press tour for Passangers with her co-star <a href="https://twitter.com/prattprattpratt">Chris Pratt</a>, I found their friendship incredibly hilarious and heart-warming.</p>

                    <p class="content-paragraph">Ryan Reynolds is a huge online troll that understand internet culture. He makes parodies and troll videos on YouTube either for pure entertainment or for advertisements. Regardless of his motivations, his work is always entertaining to watch. And the videos he produces are full productions with proper editing, proper lighting, and full well-thought-out concepts.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-heading">Sarah Paulson</h2>
                    <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://i.insider.com/60d1f9e1db3f80001848d324?width=700"> 
                    <p class="content-paragraph"> Sarah Paulson is an actress from American Horror Story. She also works heavily with writer Ryan Murphy who produces many hit series such as Ratched, American Horror Story, 911, and The People vs OJ. </p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph"> I adore Sarah Paulson for many reasons. First and foremost, her acting is beyond phenomenal. She knows how to completely transform herself into the character she's told to play. She convinces you that she's this new character, and she makes you forget the characters she played in the past. She's versatile, similar to her American Horror Story co-stars <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilyrabe/">Lily Rabe</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetonourface">Evan Peters</a>, Jessica Lange, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ImAngelaBassett?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Angela Bassett</a></p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph"> Additionally, she's very charismatic off-screen. She also goes viral every time Ellen Degeneress sneaks up on her and scares her. Those clips of her getting scared get anywhere from 5M to 12M views.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-heading">Ashton Kutcher</h2>

                     <p class="content-paragraph"> Ashton Kutcher was on that 70s show. I know he has been in many other motion pictures, but That 70s Show is probably the only work of his I actually watched. I appreciate this guy because he is incredibly intelligent. He's a businessman and investor. He's also a philanthropist. I love watching his speeches and businesses conferences because he always teaches new ideas that I have never explored. When he talks, you can tell he is speaking with passion and knowledge. He genuinely knows the subject he speaks on, and his opinions are always informed. I respect him, what he stands for, and his rationale.</p>
