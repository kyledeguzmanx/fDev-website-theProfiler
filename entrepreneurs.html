                        <p class="content-paragraph" style=" padding-top:50px;"> I was reading something a few months ago that was basically saying CEOs of tech companies are becoming a new category of celebrity-- and it's interesting because we only see this in tech. People don't really care about CEOs in other industries. I find that interesting because it's true. But even if these tech heads are household names, it doesn't necessarily mean everyone's obsessed with them. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph" >For this page, I want to talk about entrepreneurs that I am personally obsessed with.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph" style= "text-indent: 0px;">Here’s the list:</p>

                        <h2 class="content-heading"><a href="index.html" style="text-decoration: none; color:red;"> Elon Musk</a></h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15a/a77/b92f3a2d6de4ac79f869b4ab5300da4c8c-elon-musk.rsquare.w700.jpg">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> He first caught my attention when he was speaking at a conference, and he was talking about the possibility that we are currently living in a simulation. I didn't really buy into the story he was selling, but I could appreciate it. After watching him speak, I was intrigued by him. I wanted to hear more about him. I learned about every single one of his companies. I learned about his motivations for pursing what he's doing. I've watched every interview, conference, or press junket he's done recently. I follow his Twitter, and I even follow dedicated social media channels that talk about what he's up to. I also keep up with the innovations his companies are bringing.</p>
                            <p class="content-paragraph">I would not classify myself as a fanboy. I can't tell you where he went to school or how old he is-- no matter how hard I try to remember. But I will say that this man is probably the only person I look up to. It feels weird identifying him as my idol, but if I did have one, it would be him. </p>

                        <h2 class="content-heading">Richard Branson</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1410740591483293697/tRbW1XoV_400x400.jpg">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Richard Branson is an extremely wealthy man. My interests in him comes in waves. Sometimes this man appears on Shark Tank, and when he talks, you can't help but admire his brain and his empire. But that's not the reason why I'm currently invested in his life. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Right now, the billionaires are fighting over space travel. Elon Musk has Starlink and SpaceX. Jeff Bezos has Blue Origin. And Richard Branson has Virgin Galactic. The press inevitablely compare all three of them, and the blog posts and YouTube videos quickly get entertaining.   </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I think that here is some filler words now to make the page look like its filled with content. Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called Student. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 1972. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he started Virgin Atlantic airline and expanded the Virgin Records music label. In 1997, Branson founded the Virgin Rail Group to bid for passenger rail franchises during the privatisation of British Rail. The Virgin Trains brand operated the InterCity West Coast franchise from 1997 to 2019, the InterCity CrossCountry franchise from 1997 to 2007, and the InterCity East Coast franchise from 2015 to 2018. In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation Virgin Galactic, based at Mojave Air and Space Port in California, noted for the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism.</p>

                        <p class="content-paragraph"> As the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey is always in the news cycle, and the headlines always get me. From talking about crypto to acquisitons to political issues, Jack Dorsey knows how to keep the people entertained.  </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Now that Jack Dorsey has amassed a large fortune, here is a huge chunk of text to fill up the page.Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri,[5][6] the son of Tim and Marcia (née Smith) Dorsey.[7][8][9] He is of Irish, German and Italian descent.[10][additional citation(s) needed] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[11] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[12] He attended the Catholic Bishop DuBourg High School. In his younger days, Dorsey worked occasionally as a fashion model.[13][14][15][16][17] By age 14, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open-source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by taxicab companies.[7] Dorsey enrolled at the University of Missouri–Rolla in 1995 and attended for two-plus years[12] before transferring to New York University in 1997, but he dropped out two years later,[18] one semester short of graduating.[12] He came up with the idea that eventually became Twitter while studying at NYU. </p>

                        <h2 class="content-heading">Dan Bilzerian</h2>
                        <img class="celeb-photo center" src="https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/dan-bilzerian-eea645f0-776a-4c3d-9dbc-8285f98c59bd.jpg?quality=86&strip=all">
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Dan Bilzerian has a networth of $200M. I can't tell if he's known more for being an Instagram star or a business man. Regardless, his lifestyle is definitely interesting enough for me to give him a follow. Bilzerian usually averages a few million likes per Instagram post, and I genuinely wonder how is this man so famous. If you Google "King of Instagram", it does not show the most followed man on Instagram. Instead, it shows Dan Bilzerian. And if you Google his name, no one really talks about anything other than his social life. This guy is full of mystery, and I think that's what makes him intriguing enough to follow. </p>

                        <h2 class="content-heading"> Honorable Mentions</h2>
                       
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Kanye West</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> I developed an appreciation for Kanye West after his interview with David Letterman for Letterman's Netflix show. From that point, not only did I become a fan of his music but I became a fan of him. He grew up in a rough neighborhood and built a billion-dollar empire through his Yeezy brand. Kanye West is inspirational. He is a trendsetter. His vision for fashion has had a huge impact on streetwear. I think he is a really cool person.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Understandably, Kanye has become a controversial person. Not ever person likes him because of the stuff he says, but I'll still support him. I have nothing else to say so here's some filler. In a story published Thursday, Bloomberg cited a UBS report that calculated the bulk of West’s wealth based on the burgeoning value of his Yeezy fashion line that has an existing deal with German sportswear giant Adidas and a hotly anticipated collection with normcore mainstay Gap.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">A favorite of sneaker collectors and the fashion press, Yeezy is now worth between $3.2 billion to $4.7 billion, primarily due to the brand’s deal with German sportswear giant Adidas. The Yeezy-Gap deal, which will see a collection released later this summer, is expected to be worth more than $970 million. West is the sole owner of the Yeezy brand.</p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Rihanna</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Rihanna has been a very busy person during her musical hiatus. She's built many different businesses in different industries, and she's now the highest-paid female musician. She has over a billion dollar networth, and it's mind blowing. Her story, similar to Kanye's, is from rags to riches. She was just a girl from Barbados that could sing, and Jay-Z took a chance on her. </p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Jay-Z</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Jay-Z is an entrepreneur. He dables in many different industries and creates many different businesses that aren't publicly tied to his name. He owns Roc-A-Fella Records and RocNation. He has ownership in the Tidal music streaming platform-- which is doing better than most people probbaly think. And Jay-Z also owns many different bars and restaurants.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I think my appreciation for Jay-Z mostly comes from the business aspect of music. Jay-Z connects with a lot of rising, Black artists, and if he really believes in them, he helps them. Artists don't really talk about it that much, but when they do, it's very admirable.</p>
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Kylie Jenner</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">I will admire anyone that can turn fifteen seconds of fame into an empire. I will admire anyone that can leverage social media and build a multi-million or billion dollar empire without advertising on traditional media. And I will admire any privileged rich kid that can build their own businesses off their parents' money. If it was genuinely that easy to build an empire, every child of an affluent politician or celebrity should be creating empires left and right. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">Take away everything Kylie Jenner and her family are known for. I can genuinely say I am in awe of their business and marketing skills. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"></p>   
                    <h3 class="content-subheading">Tim Cook</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> Even if I don't plan on buying any Apple products, I still love to watch their press conferences and follow them on social media. I love seeing what they're up to because Apple is a company of innovation. They have built and are continuing to expand their ecosystem of devices that work so beautifully and harmoniously with one another. Other brands can replicate the individual products Apple creates, but they can never replicate that ease-of-use and integration Apple can provide. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph"> It's really interesting to learn why that is. Part of that answer travels towards the impact Steve Jobs had on the company. But moving on from Steve Jobs, we have Tim Cook who is the CEO of Apple. Tim Cook speaking at events or doing interviews always captures my attention.</p>
